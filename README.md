# 🏦 Loan_Approval_Prediction_ML_project

This project aims to predict whether a **loan application will be approved or rejected** using a **Logistic Regression model**.  
It demonstrates the complete data science workflow — from **data preprocessing and feature scaling** to **model training, evaluation, and interpretation**.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

Loan approval is one of the most common use cases in banking analytics.  
By analyzing applicant data such as income, loan amount, credit score, and asset values,  
the model predicts the probability of loan approval.

## 🚀 Features

- Uploads a dataset directly via Google Colab
- Cleans and preprocesses data (handles missing values and encodes categorical features)
- Scales numerical columns using `StandardScaler`
- Splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** model
- Evaluates the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualizes results for better interpretation
